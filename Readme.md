# Pommodoro Totem with green and red leds

* 1. Red led means "I'm busy. Don't disturb me!!!"
* 2. Green led means "Relaxing time. Time to drink beer!!"

This first version is a infinite loop:
* Starts in mode dontDisturb.
* After 5 seconds, switch to relaxTime
* After 5 seconds, switch to dontDisturb
* Repeat the loop forever
